Edit Readme Tommy !!

Ah ha! I can edit this. then make a commit.
We shall see if it commits to my git or yours.

When I commit changes, it becomes a part of MY git.

Oh I was wrong! It worked perfectly!!!!
Awesome. I just saw the folder "Tommy" and assumed I was on my git, not yours.
I can edit files in my "Tommy" folder directly and when I "commit" them, they save directly to Your git.
