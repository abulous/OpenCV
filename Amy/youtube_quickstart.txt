Want to use YouTube videos in your python project? Or create your own and run an automated channel?
Two things to know about:
1) YouTube API -- which lets you not only query and filter, but also upload, comment, and do just about
everything else to your channel.
2) The youtube-dl script. Originally it only could download, so your search & filtering had to be done through the
API. Recent versions have added search & filtering capabilities, so you may or may not still need the API.


Getting started with YouTube API:
https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/
(Or jump to Step 4 to go straight to youtube-dl downloading)

Step 1: Create a project and create an API key (Only have to do this once.)
https://developers.google.com/y…/registering_an_application…

Step 2:
Install the Google API client
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client

Step 3:
Play with the example code. (Don't forget to fill in your API key.)
https://developers.google.com/youtube/…/code_samples/python…

In the right side bar, you'll see they have examples for how to do just about anything on YouTube via the API.

Step 4:
To actually download, you can use youtube-dl
https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl
(Easiest way: just add a line to your python script to call it: os.system("youtube-dl [whatever options]").
You'll need to reconstruct the input URL using your search results: i.e. youtube-dl [whatever options]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=" + search_result["id"]["videoId"]


*** Note that recent versions of youtube-dl include a lot of functionality for search and qualifiers. You probably still need youtube api, but check out the capabilities.  There's also a youtube-dl python module.
